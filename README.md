## My Projects

- Malware Bazaar script will download malware hashes and store them in csv file. Feodo Tracker  script same functions but latest C2 servers IP. URL Haus script is going to collect latest active domain names for malware distributed sites and store in new .csv file format. Threat Fox script will help you to gather latest distributed examples of malware hashes (MD5, SHA1,SHA256), IP's and full URI to malware distributed sites. Hope that this could potentially help you to use them for example in SIEM console to catch or monitor systems for any possible threat.
