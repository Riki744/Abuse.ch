## What is Abuse.ch?
abuse.ch is providing community driven threat intelligence on cyber threats. It is the home of a couple of projects that are helping internet service providers and network operators protecting their infrastructure from malware. IT-Security researchers, vendors and law enforcement agencies rely on data from abuse.ch, trying to make the internet a safer place.

## My Projects

- I've created three scripts. Malware Bazaar script will download malware hashes and store them in csv file. Feodo Tracker  script same functions but latest C2 servers IP. URL Haus script is going to collect latest active domain names for malware distributed sites and store in new .csv file format. Hope that this could potentially help you to use them for example in SIEM console to catch or monitor systems for any possible threat.
