## What is Abuse.ch?
abuse.ch is providing community driven threat intelligence on cyber threats. It is the home of a couple of projects that are helping internet service providers and network operators protecting their infrastructure from malware. IT-Security researchers, vendors and law enforcement agencies rely on data from abuse.ch, trying to make the internet a safer place.

## My Projects

- I've created two scripts which will download malware hashes and store them in csv file and second script same functions but latest C2 servers, I hope that this could potentially help you to use them for example in SIEM console to catch or monitor systems for any possible threat.

## Future Projects

- [ ] SSL Blacklist
- [ ] URL Haus
- [ ] Threat Fox
